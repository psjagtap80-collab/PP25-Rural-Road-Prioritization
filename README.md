# PP25: Rural Road Upgradation Prioritization Framework

## Overview
PP25 is a decision-support framework developed for rural road upgradation prioritization under budget constraints. The framework integrates accessibility indicators, socio-economic factors, network performance metrics, and multi-criteria optimization logic.

This repository provides documentation, sample input formats, output results, and supplementary materials supporting the published research article.

## Software Availability
The PP25 computational tool is protected under copyright and is not publicly distributed.
